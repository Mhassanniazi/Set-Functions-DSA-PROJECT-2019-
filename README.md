Hi, This project contains the functions of sets in python without use of built-in functions.
The .py File contains the functions of Sets which are own implemented. The instructions about the functions is below:

union 		           --> This function could be called to achieve the union of the two given sets.
intersection 	       --> This function could be called to achieve the Intersection of two given sets that is common elements in both sets.
difference 	         --> This function could be called to get the elements present the first set but not in the second set.
symmetricdifference  --> This function could be called to get the symmetric difference of two sets i.e: (A-B) U (B-A). The elements belong to A or B but not belong to both.
disjointsets         --> This function could be called to check whether the two sets are disjoint or not i.e: No elements in common.
sett                 --> This function could be called to get an unique set. In other words, this function fulfils the definition of sets.
